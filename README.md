# Forum-end-year-1
A forum for my end assignment for the class PHP. The forum is mainly focused on functionality and not much on style

This is a project meant as end-assignment for year one, this is mainly focused on code and as learning project.
quite some things are not implemented becuase they wouldnt add anything to the learning progress since it would be repeating stuff i already did
